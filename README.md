# Airbnb Project

Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service, enabling people to lease or rent short-term lodging including vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, hostel beds, or hotel rooms. The company does not own any lodging; it is merely a broker & receives percentage service fees (commissions) from both guests & hosts in conjunction with every booking.

In this project, I used questions to guide my exploration on of the dataset to pick up on any trends or insights on the different neighborhoods, the pricing, as well as the satisfaction levels based on reviews.

I also created a input-based application for customers to visualise possible listings on a map depending on how they want to filter price, overall satisfaction (number of stars), & neighborhood. Prospective hosts can also use the application to give them a gauge on the price to set per night for their listing, which will be calculated by taking the average prices of the other listings within the same neighborhood.

I have included the Python notebook (Jupyter) containing my code, as well as the dataset that I used.
